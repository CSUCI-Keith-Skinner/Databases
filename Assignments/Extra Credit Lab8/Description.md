# A8 Extra Credit Description

In the programming language of your choice, construct an application (GUI preferred) to interact with the AirSupply database. Your application should accommodate CRUD functionality for reading database data. Your application should also consider proper security constraints and include dedicated application-specific login credentials and permissions granted for specific db objects.

## Part 1 (Focus on Security)

(10pts) Create a new user for your application. This system should have the appropriate user permissions to only access views and stored procedures constructed in Lab 5. Show both the create statement for this user and permissions granted from the mysql data dictionary.

## Part 2 and 3 (Focus on Application Development)

The grading breakdown for Part II and III will be based on the [Technology Acceptance Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_acceptance_model):

Usefulness (20pts) – Of a suitable level of complexity, your system will include functionality for querying and presenting pertinent database information, including dynamic information, based on arguments passed in from the application terminal or GUI. Your application should be able to process the views and stored procedures creating in Lab 5.

Ease of Use (10%) – The system should be simple and easy to use for the end-user and provides explicitly instructions for functionality and required data input.
